# DATA-STRUCTURE-PROJECT
Here, I am going to upload for DATA STRUCTURE MINI PROJECT (i.e) on Graphs, Probability and Theory. 
In data structures, graphs are used to represent relationships between entities. 
Graph algorithms can be applied to analyze networks, such as social networks or computer networks. Probability theory is used to analyze the likelihood of events occurring, which is useful in designing algorithms that involve randomness or uncertainty. 
In the context of data structures, probability theory can be used in the analysis of randomized algorithms. 
Theoretical aspects of data structures involve studying the efficiency and complexity of algorithms, often using mathematical tools to analyze their performance and properties. 
This includes topics like time complexity, space complexity, and algorithmic correctness. Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. 
It provides a framework for quantifying uncertainty and making informed decisions in the presence of randomness.
